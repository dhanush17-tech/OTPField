# OTP Field UI

![Alt Text](https://github.com/dhanush17-tech/OTPField/blob/master/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

There's a timer that shows how much time is remaining to enter the OTP. If you enter the correct OTP within the two-minute window, the app will show a green checkmark and a message that says "Verified". If you don't enter the correct OTP within two minutes, you can request a new OTP or change your phone number.
